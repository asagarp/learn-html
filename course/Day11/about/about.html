                Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic
and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how
smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades
may struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt
is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government
officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the
subject of money.
